% 1. Analizar Vulnerabilidades de un Sistema Operativo


% SO a analizar (RAZON)
%(ALEX)
% 1. Windows :  más usados en entornos empresariales y personales. Tiene una gran cantidad de vulnerabilidades 
                %documentadas, especialmente relacionadas con configuraciones inseguras y ataques de malware.
                    % Áreas comunes de vulnerabilidad:
                    % Explotación de vulnerabilidades en servicios de red.
                    % Ataques de malware y ransomware.
                    % Protocolos como SMB (e.g., WannaCry).
                    % Servicios como RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).
                    % Deficiencias en el control de cuentas de usuario (UAC).

% 2. Linux  :   usado en servidores, sistemas embebidos, y dispositivos IoT. Es crucial para el análisis de 
                %vulnerabilidades en configuraciones de red y software de código abierto.
                    % Áreas comunes de vulnerabilidad:
                    % Explotación de vulnerabilidades en servicios de red.
                    % Errores de configuración de permisos y servicios.
                    % Vulnerabilidades en paquetes como OpenSSL, Apache, y Samba.
                    % Kernel exploits.
                %Ubuntu
                %Fedora 
                %min
                %Manjaro



% 3. MacOS  :   Aunque menos frecuente en sistemas empresariales, macOS es relevante debido a su creciente uso 
                % en entornos de desarrollo y administración.
                    % Áreas comunes de vulnerabilidad:
                    % Explotación de vulnerabilidades en servicios de red.
                    % Ataques de malware y ransomware.
                    % Vulnerabilidades en aplicaciones de terceros.
                    % Errores de configuración de permisos y servicios.
                    % Puertas traseras en servicios nativos como Bonjour.
                    % Errores en el sandboxing de aplicaciones.
                    % Dependencias de software de terceros como Chromium o WebKit.

                    % Mac Os X
                    % Macos


%(ALLAN)
% 4. Android:   Sistema operativo móvil dominante, Android tiene vulnerabilidades relacionadas con aplicaciones 
                % maliciosas, permisos y fragmentación de versiones.
                    % Áreas comunes de vulnerabilidad:
                    % Aplicaciones maliciosas y malware.
                    % Vulnerabilidades en servicios de red.
                    % Errores de configuración de permisos.
                    % Fragmentación de versiones y actualizaciones.
                    % Vulnerabilidades en el kernel de Linux
                    % Escalamiento de privilegios.
                    % Errores en componentes como WebView.
                    % Exposición de datos sensibles en apps.

% 5. Solaris:   Usado en entornos empresariales con aplicaciones específicas.
                    % Áreas comunes de vulnerabilidad:


% 6.FreeBSD:    Importantes en sistemas críticos donde se prioriza la seguridad
                % Áreas comunes de vulnerabilidad:
                % Exploits en configuraciones de red.
                % Fallos en servicios básicos como SSH o DNS.
                % Exploits en configuraciones de red.
                % Fallos en servicios básicos como SSH o DNS.

By sending a malformed FileNormalizedNameInformation SMBv3 request over a named pipe, an attacker can cause a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) crash of the Windows kernel. For most systems, this attack requires authentication, except in the special case of Windows Domain Controllers, where unauthenticated users can always open named pipes as long as they can establish an SMB session.
